message: "> There’s very few examples in yours or others (about text).\r\n\r\nI do think that there isn't a lot of resources about dealing with text object in Animation Nodes, either in the documentation, my posts or others'. Other people have expressed frustration about this as well. There is a reason for this (at least for me) and I will explain that in my next point.\r\n\r\n> Text can be separated into Objects via node. .... Text, tends to need to be either converted to mesh (or curves) or broken down via the separate text objects node.\r\n\r\nThe thing about texts in Animation Nodes is that we rely on blender's text objects and font data, those objects and data being limited, in turn limit us when we try to make something out of it. One of the many limitations is the non-ability to control individual properties of the characters of text objects, as you stated, one can use the *Separate Text Objects node* to separate the text into individual characters then edit their properties as he wish, however, this is very inefficient and impose even more limitations. In fact, I think this node destroys everything Animation Nodes is trying to be because it is what I call an **\"operational\"** node, it doesn't fit in the design of AN, it can't be used along side other nodes. Those facts stops me (and may be others) from creating anything with text in AN (or in blender), it simply isn't working.\r\n\r\nWhat to do about it? Well, we can overcome some of the limitations with workarounds, those workarounds are of course still inefficient, as an example, consider this [question](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/89311/an-separate-text-object-separate-to-words) which I answered with a workaround which the asker in turn used to do:\r\n\r\n![Example](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wgp1o.gif)\r\n\r\nThe solution to our text problem is obvious, AN need to have its own text system. However, I imagine it is very hard for Jacques to implement something like this, even if he decided to, I imagine it won't be anytime soon.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that the documentation will have a detailed guide to texts next month, this might guide you through some of what you are trying to do.\r\n\r\nI think that explains why nobody wants to deal with texts and I understand your frustration because I feel just like you.\r\n\r\n> Also, a number of your node examples, I’ve noticed Jacques doing the same thing, have nodes off frame connected to something else.\r\n\r\nWe do this because:\r\n\r\n1. We want the reader to stop reading for a second, start thinking, and try to guess what should be the nodes off-frame. This encourage self-study.\r\n2. Sometimes the off-frame nodes are just visible in another screenshot.\r\n3. Sometimes it is obvious.\r\n\r\nI understand that it might sometime be annoying, but hey, you can always ask for feedback in any form and we will most certainly answer you.\r\n\r\n> Sverchok has built in the ability to import and export nodes via JSON or via Github. It would be nice, across nodes - materials, textures, compositing, animation, sverchok to have a uniform ability to save, share, import and export nodes.\r\n\r\nI believe Jacques is working on that currently, you should probably expect it in `v2.1`. Developments happens in the `Templates` branch if I am not mistaken.\r\n\r\nI will personally start to provide blend files and probably the templates files in the future. I have a resource section in the blog that needs to be filled.\r\n\r\n> Even Jacques, the developer, has noted the addition, absence, deprecation, elimination of nodes as a part of the development, improvement process. So, the task of keeping up with what can be done and how is a moving target.\r\n\r\nI understand, I personally have to rewrite some parts of my blog every time something changes. But it is a price we have to pay for innovation and development. It should be noted that there is a very detailed release notes with examples that inform you of whatever was removed, added or changed. This should save you from what you just mentioned. Here is the [release notes](http://animation-nodes-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release_notes/v2_0/index.html) of `v2.0`. Also, the documentation is updated even before the new version gets released, so if you get stuck, you can just go visit the documentation. As you said, the documentation was improved and will further improve and as I said, there will be guides for everything soon enough.\r\n\r\n> I take issue with the saying “Those who can, do. Those who can’t, teach.”\r\n\r\nI definitely agree with what you have to say about this quote.\r\n\r\nLastly, I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and comments with me. Thanks !"
