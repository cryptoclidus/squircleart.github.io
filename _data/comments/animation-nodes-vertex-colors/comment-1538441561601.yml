  Thank you for posting this! There is *so* little information out there on how
  Blender treats polygons, loops, and vertices. I've been poring over the
  internet for just this info for days on end, and only now—after finding your
  post through, ironically, an image search—do I know what a loop actually is! I
  wish this info was in the Blender manual for an easy find (or maybe it is and
  it just doesn't rank high on a Google search).
