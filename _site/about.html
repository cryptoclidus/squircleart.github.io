<h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
<img src="/images/Elephant.png" style="border:5px solid #333">
<p>My name is <strong>Omar Ahmad</strong>.</p>
<p>I am 17 years old.</p>
<p>I am not a cute elephant, But this is how I am known to the universe.</p>
<p>I have been using <strong>Blender</strong> for 3 years now.</p>
<p>I started as a <strong>CG Generalist</strong>, Doing freelancing and working for local business.</p>
<p>As I developed myself as an artist, I started to see the importance of maths and sciences in my field of work and other fields.</p>
<p>It is amazing how maths solve world&rsquo;s problems with consistency and accuracy, and that made me change my career from being an Artist to a <strong>Technical Director</strong>.</p>
<p>From that moment, I started learning more math and physics too keep up.And I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes">Animation Nodes</a> Which instantly become my favourite framework to do everything my imagination can come up with!</p>
<p>In this blog, I am aiming to provide you with resources and information to be a better artist or a real problem solver.</p>
