message: "I can provide compiled versions for Arch Linux, but no other operating system. The array branch is not designed to be used by anyone other than me, most nodes will give you errors if you attempted to use them because they should be used in a special way, though I will try to make the branch usable for anyone.\r\n\r\nFor the solidify branch, I will try to get it to official version of AN, though I don't know when or if it will happen."
