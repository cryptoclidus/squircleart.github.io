message: "Hi Gregor, Thanks for following my tutorials.\r\nThe *Text Object Output Node* was vectorized in Animation Nodes v2.0. So in order to make it accept lists, you have to download a recent version of AN from [here](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes/releases). Let me know if you need any help."
