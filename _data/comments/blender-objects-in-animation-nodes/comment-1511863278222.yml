message: "Even Jacques, the developer, has noted the addition, absence, deprecation, elimination of nodes as a part of the development, improvement process.  So, the task of keeping up with what can be done and how is a moving target.  There was some really great stuff done a few years back that now is easily outdated given the changes to the most current version of Animation Nodes.  Kudos to Jacques for vastly improving the documentation.  And again to you and others for sharing your understanding and expertise.  I take issue with the saying \"Those who can, do.  Those who can't, teach.\"  We ALL get our understanding and experience from somewhere.  There are those of us who are intuitive, gifted, and those of us who are not.\r\n\r\nAnd I would take issue with the perceptions of that quote against what I've seen done by so many who teach.  Apparently, you, they are \"do\"ing quite well.\r\n\r\nWe all have different ways of \"do\"ing and different ways of learning.  The quote seems somewhat arrogant and shortsighted in regards to that reality.\r\n\r\nMore observations.\r\n\r\nThanx"
