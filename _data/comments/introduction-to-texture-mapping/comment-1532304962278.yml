message: "Less a comment than a question: Say I have a circular map of the topology of the moon. NASA posts images of that sort on their website. An example:\r\n\r\nhttps://moon.nasa.gov/resources/87/high-resolution-topographic-map-of-the-moon/\r\n\r\nThe map is a 2-D image of a 3-D sphere. There is a similar image for the opposite side of the moon. As a newcomer to 3-D animation: is there a way to map these images onto the surface of a sphere (e.g., to capture surface elevation)? Thanks in advance for an answer if you have one!"
