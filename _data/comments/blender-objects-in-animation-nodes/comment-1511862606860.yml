message: "You mention text as an object, but, there's very few examples in yours (or others, including Jacques updates) on what can be done with text.  Zach Hixson has just begun to touch upon text.  MiesnerMedia is another one with a C4D Mograph tutorial,  Thinking Penguin has done some work with text as has Jimmy Gunawan over at Blender Sushi (actually, the most that I've seen).\r\n\r\nText can be separated into Objects via node.  Then it becomes problematic (at least for me) as to how to get it from there into something say as simple as an array controlled by an empty.\r\n\r\nWell there are examples of how it's done.  Granted, but, with other objects.  Text, tends to need to be either converted to mesh (or curves) or broken down via the separate text objects node.  As such, it's not the same as other objects.  So knowing that it can be done with other objects doesn't seem to be enough clarification for  doing it with text.\r\n\r\nI give credit to ALL who know far more than I do about Blender and how to make it sing and dance.  I appreciate ALL that Blender does for FREE.  I'm not unappreciative.\r\n\r\nMore on text would be nice.\r\n\r\nAlso, a number of your node examples, I've noticed Jacques doing the same thing, have nodes off frame connected to something else.  I've mentioned it on Blender Artists.  Maybe I missed it, or am just not up on the technique.  My apologies.  It won't be the first (or likely the last time).  Sverchok has built in the ability to import and export nodes via JSON or via Github.  It would be nice, across nodes - materials, textures, compositing, animation, sverchok to have a uniform ability to save, share, import and export nodes.  Even complex, detailed examples and explanations of nodes don't take the place of a blender file or easier access to the nodes absent that.\r\n\r\nI REALLY appreciate what you and others are doing with Animation Nodes and your willingness to share and create ALL this useful material.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.  \r\n\r\nSuggestions, comments, criticism - welcome.\r\n\r\nThankx"
