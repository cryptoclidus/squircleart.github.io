  Omar, thank you for taking the time to do these examples, I have been looking
  for some in-depth explanations like this. I understand vectors, matrices etc.
  as I used to delve a little in game development. What I have problems with is
  know which nodes to use as it's not always apparent. Does this just come with
  practice?
