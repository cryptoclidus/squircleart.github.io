message: "Hi Paulo,\r\n1. Yes, I think you can consider them as planer projections. \r\n2. While I am not familiar with any specialized projection method for procedural modeling, I don't think triplanar projection is the answer. In procedural modeling, you usually know much more about your objects and the formulas that describe them. For instance, the gradient of a terrain described using a simplex noise can be used to aid texture coordinates generation improving the uniformity of the projection. So, I would suggest you spend some more time researching better methods for projection. Sorry I couldn't be of help here."
